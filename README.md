Evaluating the safety of terms and conditions is crucial for understanding the implications of any agreement. This project aims to provide a simple, automated way to assess the safety of terms and conditions by identifying potentially risky keywords and visualizing the results.

## Features

- *Read Terms and Conditions*: Reads terms from a specified file.
- *Evaluate Safety*: Analyzes the terms for the presence of predefined risky keywords.
- *Visualize Results*: Generates a pie chart to visualize the safety evaluation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terms_evaluator.git
