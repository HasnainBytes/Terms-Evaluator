# Terms Evaluator

## Project Overview

The Terms Evaluator project aims to help users automatically evaluate the safety of terms and conditions documents. It runs as a background service, monitoring for new terms and conditions, evaluating them using predefined unsafe keywords, and notifying the user with a summary. Additionally, it provides visualizations to give a clear understanding of the safety of the terms and conditions.

## Features

- *Automatic Monitoring*: Continuously monitors a specified file for updates.
- *Evaluation*: Analyzes terms and conditions for potentially unsafe keywords.
- *Notification*: Sends desktop notifications with a summary of the evaluation.
- *Visualization*: Generates pie charts to visually represent the safety of the terms and conditions.
- *User Interaction*: Allows users to see more detailed information by clicking on the notifications.
